excerpt: "Redesigned the cover"

I was so eager to get my first novel, *Shadow Eclipse: Voyage*, out on Hallowe'en that I put it out with good cover art but not the best font and graphic design. This has now been redone and I'm very happy with it! What do you think?

The red to yellow transition on 'Shadow Eclipse' reminds me of [Baen books](https://www.baen.com), which I love, and it turns out it is possible to get a shiny, gold effect using only photoshop.
