title: "A newer paper!"
excerpt: "On investigations to show that something is also something else."
---
Previously, we showed that something was not something (as believed by someone), but actually something else. Further work shows that in fact something is not only something else, but sometimes is it also something!

# Further work:
We hypothesis that this may be because sometimes something is equilivalent to something else, but that is going to require a lot of further funding.
