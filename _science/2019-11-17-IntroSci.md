Welcome to the science section! 

In this section I will talk about my career as a scientist, from the research I've been involved with, how research is done, my teaching and 'how-to's for a scientific career. 

I've been a post-doc now for around 10 years and I've jumped across fields from computational chemistry, to using chemistry to make computers, from watching braincells compute to making brain-like computers, in software, hardware and wetware. I'm going to post my papers up here (where I am allowed to by publisher's rules) and write a little about them, like how they came about, where the ideas came from, or what they actually showed.
